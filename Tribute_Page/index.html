                    and began teaching a placement-oriented course in C++ in 2020. Her teaching methods gained popularity

                <h2>My Personal Experience</h2>

                <p>I started watching coding lectures at Apna College on YouTube. The first lecture that I watched was of Arrays.
                    I was never able to understand coding taught in my college but Shradha Khapra made it possible. I loved the way she taught 
                    and made even the most complex topics a cake-walk. Topics like Recursion, Backtracking, OOPS, etc were some of the concepts
                    I could never grasp, but after understanding them from Shradha, made me develop interest in these as well.  
                </p>

                <p>I have currently puchased two paid courses, one is of Data Structures and Algorithms using Java and another is of Full 
                    Stack Web Development, in order to learn and grow in tech field. Shradhha teaches in a way that all my basics are cleared and 
                    I find myself placement ready.
                </p>
